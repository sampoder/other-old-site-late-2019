## Summary of Project

For our science project we will be developing a algorithm that uses accelerometer and gyroscope data to detect when someone falls. Alongside this will be a smartphone app that can receive the results and send a text warning to a phone number if needed. To build a connection to the internet, the device will use a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone via an IOT platform called Blynk. This device will be based on an Arduino 101 board as it has a built in accelerometer and gyroscope sensor that can be accessed using the CurieIMU open source code library.
